## Assignment Description 

The slot machine (HTML5/Javascript/ReactJS)


A slot machine is the machine you can see in many casinos where people insert a coin and then there are three wheels spinning with some fruits or symbols inside. In this case, we cannot enter coins

The behavior will be as follows:
1.     The machine has 3 wheels. Each wheel has 4 symbols (strawberry, banana, orange and a monkey). Do not overdo the design. In our case, the machine can show only one symbol per wheel.
2.     The machine starts with the symbols in some random position
3.     The machine has a start button. When the user presses it, then the wheels spin (a symbol every, 50ms)
4.     If the user doesn’t press start, then the machine does it automatically after 5 seconds
5.     If the user doesn’t press stop, the machine stops automatically after 10 seconds (after starting)
6.     The machine has a stop button. When the user presses it, then the wheels stop. If all the wheels show the two or more symbols of the same type, then we have a prize!!!. Two identical non-consecutive symbols, the prize is 10 dollars, Two consecutive symbols, then the prize is 20 dollars. The same symbol in all the wheels, the prize is 100 dollars


> Please, come with a reasonable simple design and a solution. It needs to be properly tested(unit tests is a must). No need of server side. Just HTML5/Javascript/React.
